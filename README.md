TheResistance
=============
Author: Andy Lau

Personal implementation of The Resistance game to aid with game play.

While playing this game without the actual board game, I noticed it was hard to keep track of past missions, like who went on which mission and whether or not it failed - even the most recent one. I decided it would be cool to implement something that could help with that. I still wanted the game to be social, so I didnt want it to be a complete replacement.
